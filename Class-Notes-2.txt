-> Create a Project in JIRA

	- Classic Project

	- Next Gen Project

-> After Project creation completed, we can create stories in backlog.

-> Backlog means pending works

-> For every task we will create story in backlog bucket

-> For Every Story one JIRA ID will be generated

-> When we create Story we should write description(who, what & why)

-> For every story we need to assign story points

		1 point  ---> 1 day story
		2 points ---> 2 days story
		3 points ---> 3 days story

Note: If we give more story points team memebers will question why those many points are required... We should be able to justify	

Note: Story will maintain Reporter name (who created that)
